# Hi, I’m @Bhavya Reddy Patlolla!

I am a passionate Data Analyst with a sharp eye for uncovering actionable insights from complex datasets. With years of experience driving insights across Supply Chain, Finance, and Customer Service, I bring a well-rounded perspective that bridges analytical rigor with real-world impact.

- I’m interested in analyzing big data and building BI dashboards using modeling tools like Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.
- I’m currently learning advanced data modeling techniques, machine learning algorithms, and cloud-based data solutions like AWS and Google BigQuery.
- I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects that involve predictive analytics, business intelligence reporting, and automation of data processes to drive actionable insights.

Throughout my career, I’ve built and optimized dashboards in Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, developed predictive models using Python, and performed advanced querying and data cleaning with SQL. I specialize in KPI tracking, data reporting, and workflow optimization - ensuring data is not just seen, but understood and used to make informed decisions.

Beyond the technical stack, I’m a highly collaborative and organized professional, comfortable working cross-functionally with clinical, technical, and executive teams. I take pride in translating data into stories that drive strategy and improve outcomes.

When I’m not deep in dashboards or SQL queries, I’m probably out on a walk, exploring new food spots, or squeezing in a workout.
